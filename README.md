# passwordgenerator

Description
This Password Generator is a Python-based application that creates secure passwords, allowing users to specify the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers. It features two modes: a straightforward version that generates the password in sequential order and an advanced version that randomizes the order of characters for enhanced security.

How It Works
The generator prompts the user to input the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password. Based on these inputs, it then either concatenates these elements in order (Easy Level) or shuffles them for a randomized outcome (Hard Level) using Python's random module.

Features
Customizable Password Composition: Users can define the number of letters, symbols, and numbers in their password.
Two Modes for Different Security Needs: Choose between an easy mode for a quick, sequential password or a hard mode for a randomized, more secure password.
Interactive User Prompts: Clear instructions guide the user through specifying their password requirements.
Built With
Python 3
Python's random module for element selection and shuffling
